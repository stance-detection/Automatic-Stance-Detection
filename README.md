# Automatic Stance Detection

## Things done

* Data preprocessing   
* lstm architecture defined  

## To do

* Improve Input taken by Lstm to be vector generated by TF-IDF for that cleantext
  Using the Glove word embeddings and embedd it to create output of accuracy from the lstm models

* word2vec
* Glove word embeddings

Also try to execute this code on the system after installing all things required (here)[https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/fnc-1/tree/master/deep_learning_model]

## ALgorithms

* Lstm
* Autoencoder

### Execution

Clone this repository and download 'google news vectors negative 300' from **[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl4j-distribution/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz)** and put it inside the word2vec folder.
Now execute execute lstm.py file
