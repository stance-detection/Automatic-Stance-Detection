# Automatic Stance Detection

## Things done

* Data preprocessing   
* lstm architecture defined  

## To do

* Improve Input taken by Lstm to be vector generated by TF-IDF for that cleantext
  Using the Glove word embeddings and embedd it to create output of accuracy from the lstm models

* word2vec
* Glove word embeddings

## ALgorithms

Lstm
Autoencoder

### Execution

Go to word2vec folder and execute lstm.py file
